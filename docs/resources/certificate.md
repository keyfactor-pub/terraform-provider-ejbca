  The EJBCA Certificate Resource allows you to enroll certificates with client-generated keys (IE keys not generated by EJBCA)
  with EJBCA according to a certificate profile, end entity profile, and CA. When ejbca_certificate resources are created,
  an End Entity is created in EJBCA which is not deleted when the resource is destroyed. If this is behavior that is
  desired, please use the ejbca_end_entity resource to generate the end entity, and reference the end entity name
  in the end_entity_name attribute of the ejbca_certificate resource.
  The EJBCA Certificate Resource uses the following EJBCA API endpoints:
  POST /v1/certificate/pkcs10enroll - Used to enroll a certificate with a PKCS#10 Certificate Signing RequestPOST /v1/certificate/search - Used to search for a certificate by serial numberGET /v1/ca/{subject_dn}/certificate/download - Used to download the CA certificate chain if it was not provided in the response from /v1/certificate/searchPUT /v1/certificate/{issuer_dn}/{certificate_serial_number}/revoke - Used to revoke a certificate
  The EJBCA Certificate Resource allows users to determine how the End Entity Name is selected at runtime. Here are the options you can use for end_entity_name:
  cn: Uses the Common Name from the CSR's Distinguished Name.dns: Uses the first DNS Name from the CSR's Subject Alternative Names (SANs).uri: Uses the first URI from the CSR's Subject Alternative Names (SANs).ip: Uses the first IP Address from the CSR's Subject Alternative Names (SANs).Custom Value: Any other string will be directly used as the End Entity Name.
  If the end_entity_name field is not explicitly set, the EJBCA Terraform Provider will attempt to determine the End Entity Name using the following default behavior:
  First, it will try to use the Common Name: It looks at the Common Name from the CSR's Distinguished Name.If the Common Name is not available, it will use the first DNS Name: It looks at the first DNS Name from the CSR's Subject Alternative Names (SANs).If the DNS Name is not available, it will use the first URI: It looks at the first URI from the CSR's Subject Alternative Names (SANs).If the URI is not available, it will use the first IP Address: It looks at the first IP Address from the CSR's Subject Alternative Names (SANs).**If none of the above are available, it will return an error.

# ejbca_certificate (Resource)

The EJBCA Certificate Resource allows you to enroll certificates with client-generated keys (IE keys not generated by EJBCA)
with EJBCA according to a certificate profile, end entity profile, and CA. When `ejbca_certificate` resources are created,
an End Entity is created in EJBCA which is **not** deleted when the resource is destroyed. If this is behavior that is
desired, please use the `ejbca_end_entity` resource to generate the end entity, and reference the end entity name
in the `end_entity_name` attribute of the `ejbca_certificate` resource.

The EJBCA Certificate Resource uses the following EJBCA API endpoints:

* `POST /v1/certificate/pkcs10enroll` - Used to enroll a certificate with a PKCS#10 Certificate Signing Request
* `POST /v1/certificate/search` - Used to search for a certificate by serial number
* `GET /v1/ca/{subject_dn}/certificate/download` - Used to download the CA certificate chain if it was not provided in the response from `/v1/certificate/search`
* `PUT /v1/certificate/{issuer_dn}/{certificate_serial_number}/revoke` - Used to revoke a certificate

The EJBCA Certificate Resource allows users to determine how the End Entity Name is selected at runtime. Here are the options you can use for `end_entity_name`:

* **`cn`:** Uses the Common Name from the CSR's Distinguished Name.
* **`dns`:** Uses the first DNS Name from the CSR's Subject Alternative Names (SANs).
* **`uri`:** Uses the first URI from the CSR's Subject Alternative Names (SANs).
* **`ip`:** Uses the first IP Address from the CSR's Subject Alternative Names (SANs).
* **Custom Value:** Any other string will be directly used as the End Entity Name.

If the `end_entity_name` field is not explicitly set, the EJBCA Terraform Provider will attempt to determine the End Entity Name using the following default behavior:

* **First, it will try to use the Common Name:** It looks at the Common Name from the CSR's Distinguished Name.
* **If the Common Name is not available, it will use the first DNS Name:** It looks at the first DNS Name from the CSR's Subject Alternative Names (SANs).
* **If the DNS Name is not available, it will use the first URI:** It looks at the first URI from the CSR's Subject Alternative Names (SANs).
* **If the URI is not available, it will use the first IP Address:** It looks at the first IP Address from the CSR's Subject Alternative Names (SANs).
* **If none of the above are available, it will return an error.

## Example Usage

```terraform
# Create a private key
resource "tls_private_key" "rsa_4096" {
  # Create a private key for the certificate request.
  algorithm = "RSA"
  rsa_bits  = 2048
}

# Create a new CSR
resource "tls_cert_request" "csr" {
  # Create a CSR using the TLS private key above
  private_key_pem = tls_private_key.rsa_4096.private_key_pem

  subject {
    common_name         = "mycsr.kfdelivery.com"
    organizational_unit = "IT"
  }
}

# Sign the CSR with EJBCA
resource "ejbca_certificate" "Certificate" {
  certificate_signing_request = tls_cert_request.csr.cert_request_pem
  certificate_profile_name    = "tlsServerAuth"
  end_entity_profile_name     = "endEntityProfileName"
  certificate_authority_name  = "ManagementCA"
  end_entity_name             = "ejbca_tf_demo"
  end_entity_password         = "password"
  account_binding_id          = "abc123"
}
```

## Schema

### Required

- `certificate_authority_name` (String) EJBCA Certificate Authority Name used to sign the certificate
- `certificate_profile_name` (String) EJBCA Certificate Profile Name to use for the certificate. Profile must exist in the connected EJBCA instance, and it must correspond to the format of the certificate_signing_request.
- `certificate_signing_request` (String) PKCS#10 PEM-encoded Certificate Signing Request
- `end_entity_profile_name` (String) EJBCA End Entity Profile Name to use for the certificate

### Optional

- `account_binding_id` (String) An account binding ID in EJBCA to associate with issued certificates.
- `end_entity_name` (String) Name of the EJBCA entity to create for the certificate
- `end_entity_password` (String) Password of the EJBCA entity. If not provided, a random password will be generated

### Read-Only

- `certificate` (String) PEM encoded X509v3 certificate and chain
- `id` (String) Serial number of the certificate
- `issuer_dn` (String) Distinguished name of the certificate issuer
